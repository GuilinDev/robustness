## Next Steps: LIME and DeepLIFT Analysis

Based on the completed analysis for Occlusion Sensitivity (OS) and previous methods, the following high-level steps are required for LIME and DeepLIFT:

1.  **LIME Experiment Execution:**
    *   Run the LIME experiments using the scripts in `experiments/scripts/lime` for both the standard and robust models.
    *   Ensure experiments cover all corruption types and severity levels.
    *   Collect all robustness metrics (Accuracy, Similarity, MI, IoU, Flip Rate, Confidence Difference, KL Divergence, Top-5 Distance, Corruption Error, Stability).

2.  **LIME Results Processing & Visualization:**
    *   Process the raw results generated from the LIME experiments.
    *   Generate heatmap visualizations for each metric, comparing standard vs. robust models across corruption types and severities (similar to the OS heatmaps).
    *   Ensure figures are saved to an appropriate location (e.g., `writing/figures/lime/`).

3.  **LIME Analysis & Writing:**
    *   Create a new section/file in `writing/secs/` dedicated to LIME analysis (e.g., `sec_lime_results.tex`).
    *   Analyze results at Severity 3 for both standard and robust models, potentially including tables.
    *   Analyze overall trends across all severities using the generated heatmaps for both models.
    *   Compare the robustness characteristics of LIME explanations between the standard and robust models.
    *   Write the detailed analysis, observations, and conclusions for LIME in the `.tex` file.

4.  **DeepLIFT Experiment Execution:**
    *   Run the DeepLIFT experiments using the scripts in `experiments/scripts/deep_lift` for both standard and robust models.
    *   Ensure experiments cover all corruption types and severity levels.
    *   Collect all robustness metrics.

5.  **DeepLIFT Results Processing & Visualization:**
    *   Process the raw DeepLIFT results.
    *   Generate corresponding heatmap visualizations (similar to LIME and OS).
    *   Save figures to an appropriate location (e.g., `writing/figures/deep_lift/`).

6.  **DeepLIFT Analysis & Writing:**
    *   Create a new section/file in `writing/secs/` for DeepLIFT analysis (e.g., `sec_deeplift_results.tex`).
    *   Perform analysis similar to steps 3b-3e for DeepLIFT.

7.  **Integration:**
    *   Integrate the new LIME and DeepLIFT sections into the main paper structure.
    *   Update any summary sections or overall comparison sections as needed.
